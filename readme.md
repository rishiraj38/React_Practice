<!-- Notes  -->
lecture 1:
1. HomeWork :- WHAT IS CDN(Content Delivery Network)? WHY DO WE USE CDN?
    // CDN is a Content Delivery Network. It is a system of distributed servers that deliver webpages and other web content to a user based on the geographic locations of the user, the origin of the webpage and a content delivery server. 

2. react is just  a javascrpt library(written by facbook developers).

3. as we justimported this cdn link in this link it just a javascript code written.

4. React.createElement('h1',{},'Hello World From React!') in this we give three arguments to the create a element the first one shows which elemnt you want to create ex - 'h1',div,p etc..  and the second argument takes the atribute inside it like ex - here i want to give h1  a id name so inside those curly braes i will write {id:'name'} and the last argument is called child where we do our things.

5. ReactElement(Object) => HTML(browser Understands)

6. to create nested child we use [] to add those childs

7. whatever if we write inside our html and then write somthing in react it will replace that .

8. whatever we make the react will work only in that section in which we render .

lecture 2 :-
 1. npm doesnot have a full form like node pakage manager

2. pakage.json is configuration for npm

3. two types of pakages we can install dev dependency(req when we are developing app) and normal depdency(used in prooduction level)

4. caret and tilde in js - caret(^ will upgrade the minor verion(not written only here)) ans tilde(~ will upgrade the major version only)

5. we donot need to push node modules to git hub because we can regenrate it using npm install.

6. just like npm npx means it will excute that bundler or will ignite that code.

7. using react using cdn is not efficient to do we should not use it.

8. Parcel-
