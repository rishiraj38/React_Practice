1. HomeWork :- WHAT IS CDN(Content Delivery Network)? WHY DO WE USE CDN?
    // CDN is a Content Delivery Network. It is a system of distributed servers that deliver webpages and other web content to a user based on the geographic locations of the user, the origin of the webpage and a content delivery server. 

2. react is just  a javascrpt library(written by facbook developers).

3. as we justimported this cdn link in this link it just a javascript code written.

4. React.createElement('h1',{},'Hello World From React!') in this we give three arguments to the create a element the first one shows which elemnt you want to create ex - 'h1',div,p etc..  and the second argument takes the atribute inside it like ex - here i want to give h1  a id name so inside those curly braes i will write {id:'name'} and the last argument is called child where we do our things.

5. ReactElement(Object) => HTML(browser Understands)

6. to create nested child we use [] to add those childs

7. whatever if we write inside our html and then write somthing in react it will replace that .

8. whatever we make the react will work only in that section in which we render .
